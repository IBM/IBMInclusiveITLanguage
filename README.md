## **What terms is IBM replacing?**

Provided below is the list of terms that have been identified as promoting racial and cultural bias. This list is updated regularly as new guidance is defined.

|Term|Replacement term|More information and rationale|
|----|----|----|
|blacklist|blocklist|As a pair, "blacklist" and "whitelist" promote racial bias by implying that black is bad and white is good. When the terms 'white' or 'black' are used in a context where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad, this usage reinforces a model that promotes racial bias.||25-Jun-20
|whitelist|allowlist||
|slave|Use the appropriate replacement for your domain, such as such as "worker", "child", "helper", "replica", "follower", or "secondary [server, node, process, or other noun]"|The use of the term "slave" in an IT context diminishes the horror of the dehumanizing practice of slavery.|
|master(when paired with slave) |Use the appropriate replacement for your domain, such as "controller", "leader", "manager", "main", "coordinator", "parent", or "primary [server, node, process, or other noun]"|The use of "master" with the term "slave" in an IT context diminishes the horror of the dehumanizing practice of slavery. Do not use "master" when a pairing with "slave" is either explicit or implied.|
||Use of the term "master" is acceptable if it is not paired with "slave" and when it is not used to convey power or control over another entity. Context is key. Examples of acceptable uses of "master" include:|Master Data Management<br/>Master Inventor<br/>Masters degree|
|master repository|main repository, primary repository|Replace when possible or appropriate. Consider using main repository or primary repository in new products/functions.||9-Nov-20
|black hat hacker|attacker|When the terms 'white' or 'black' are used in a context where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad, this usage reinforces a model that promotes racial bias. The terms "white hat" and "black hat" promote racial bias because black is used to indicate malevolence while white indicates ethical, positive behavior.|
|white hat hacker|offensive security researcher||
|Chinese wall|Use "ethical wall" or "firewall"|This term is outdated and might be perceived as culturally insensitive or offensive because it inappropriately refers to ethnicity.|
|man hour, man day|Use "person hour" and "person day"|These terms use "man" to represent all workers. This is biased language that excludes women.|
